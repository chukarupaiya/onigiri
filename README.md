Contract Onigiri{

Constructor(){
  Onigiri brings various de-fi protocols under one roof which makes controlling assets easier.
}

function Problem() public{
	Right now there arenâ€™t any platforms where the user can track all of his defi investment. 
  Moreover, if a user wishes to invest in different protocols, he/she must navigate through each of the protocol's websites 
  and make an investment in each of them, which is more time-consuming as well as cumbersome to remember and track them.
}

function Our_Solution() public{
	We've interfaced our onigiri contract to protocols like uniswapV3 and sushiswap, and there are yet more on the way. 
  The user can now invest in several protocols from our web app. 
  Since the user invests through our contract, there are more transactions, 
  but because of the low gas price in the polygon chain, it has no effect on the overall transaction cost.
  we have also developed a dashboard using APIs to retrieve the user's defi liquidity, delegation, stakes, lends, and other information.
}   

function Future_Plans() public{
	Onigiri is now only integrated with uniswapV3 and sushiswap, but we are investigating staking, lending, and other defi options. 
  New features like limit orders, smart pools, investing strategies, etc. are also something we wish to introduce. 
  We aim to reach out to different chains including Phantom, Binance and Optimism in the future.
